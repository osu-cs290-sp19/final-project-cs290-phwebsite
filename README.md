# Coffin's Calculations: A PH 211 Equation Database
	This website uses HTML, CSS, and JS to create a database of PH 211 equations.

	This website was created using node.js with the following modules:
		Express: https://expressjs.com/
		Handlebars: https://handlebarsjs.com/
		Express-Handlebars: https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars


	For special charcters this website utilizes laTex notion thanks to http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex 


		If you want to add your own equations special characters require an extra backslash "\"  before any backslash . 
				Such as "\\Delta" instead of the regular laTex notation for delta "\Delta"
